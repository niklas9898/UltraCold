     * @brief Function to create a mesh in Fourier space
     * @author Santo Maria Roccuzzo (santom.roccuzzo@gmail.com)
     *
     * This function allows to generate a mesh in Fourier space, starting from a corresponding mesh in real,
     * cartesian space. It is also useful to plot the Fourier transform of a Vector. \n
     * The function is used as follows
     *
     * \code {.cpp}
     *
     * create_mesh_in_Fourier_space(x,kx);          // for a 1D problem
     * create_mesh_in_Fourier_space(x,y,kx,ky);     // for a 2D problem
     * create_mesh_in_Fourier_space(x,y,z,kx,ky,kz) // for a 3D problem
     *
     * \endcode
     *
     * This will take the three Vectors x,y and z, representing a mesh in real space, and use them to generate the
     * corresponding mesh in Fourier space. \n
     *
