         *
         * The Gross-Pitaevskii equation allows to obtain information on the ground-state properties of an
         * ultra-cold bosonic system by searching for stationary solutions of the form
         * \f$ \psi({\bf r},t)=\psi_0({\bf r})e^{-i\mu t/\hbar} \f$, obtaining the stationary Gross-Pitaevskii
         * equation
         * \f[
         * \mu \psi_0 = \left[ \frac{-\hbar^2\nabla^2}{2m}+V_{ext}({\bf r})+ g|\psi_0|^2 \right]\psi_0
         * \f]
         * where \f$ g \f$ is related to the s-wave scattering length \f$ a \f$ by \f$ g=\frac{4\pi\hbar^2 a}{2m} \f$.
         * Solving this for the smallest eigenvalue \f$ \mu \f$, which represents the chemical potential,
         * gives access to the ground-state configuration of the system. \n
         * In order to solve this equation, one can notice that it can be obtained from a constrained minimization
         * formulation of the problem, in particular by requiring that the ground-state order parameter of
         * the system is the exact minimizer of the mean-field energy functional
         * \f[
         * E[\psi] = \int d{\bf r} \left[ \psi^*({\bf r})\left(\frac{-\hbar^2\nabla^2}{2m}+
         * V_{ext}({\bf r})\right)\psi({\bf r}) \right] +\frac{g}{2}\int d{\bf r} |\psi({\bf r})|^4
         * \f]
         * under the constraint of a fixed number of particles \f$ \int d{\bf r}|\psi({\bf r})|^2=N \f$. This allows
         * also to introduce the chemical potential \f$ \mu \f$ as the Lagrange multiplier fixing the total number
         * of particles. One can hence find the ground state order parameter and chemical potential using, for
         * example, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent"> gradient descent </a> method, which
         * is the one implemented in this function. \n
         * The idea is to start from a guess solution \f$\psi_0\f$ and generate a sequence of iterates
         * \f$ \{\psi_n\}_{\{n=0,...,\infty\}} \f$ that terminates when one is sufficiently confident to have
         * reached a (hopefully global) minimizer of the mean-field energy functional with good accuracy. In
         * particular, a good stopping criterion consists in fixing a tolerance threshold \f$\epsilon\f$
         * (which, for this function, is a user-defined input parameter) for the norm of the residual, i.e.
         * \f$ || \hat{H}\psi_n − \mu_n \psi_n ||^2 \leq \epsilon \f$, where \f$\hat{H}\f$ is the mean-field
         * Hamiltonian of the system and the estimate \f$ \mu_n \f$ of the chemical potential \f$ \mu \f$ at
         * iteration \f$ n \f$ can be calculated as
         * \f$ \mu_n = \langle \psi_n | \hat{H} | \psi_n \rangle /  \langle \psi_n | \psi_n \rangle \f$. \n
         * In deciding how to move from one iterate \f$ \psi_n \f$ to the next \f$ \psi_{n+1} \f$, line search
         * algorithms like the gradient descent method use information about the functional
         * \f$ E[\psi] \f$ at \f$ \psi_n \f$, and possibly also from earlier iterates
         * \f$ \psi_0, \psi_1, \dots, \psi_{n-1} \f$. The update criterion should be that the energy functional is
         * smaller in \f$ \psi_{n+1} \f$ then in \f$ \psi_n \f$. One thus generates a sequence
         * \f$ \psi_{n+1} = \psi_n + \alpha \chi_n \f$ such that \f$ E[\psi_{n+1}]
         * < E[\psi_n] < \dots < E[ \psi_0 ] \f$ until the stopping criterion is satisfied. The update ”direction”
         * \f$ \chi_n \f$ must thus be chosen to be a descent direction, i.e. a direction along which the functional
         * \f$ E[\psi] \f$ decreases. The step-length \f$ \alpha \f$
         * should instead be (ideally) chosen in such a way that the decrease in the energy functional is, at
         * each iteration step, the maximum possible. Since this is not, in general, an easy task, in this
         * function we accept the compromise to choose the step length \f$ \alpha \f$ empirically as an input
         * parameter at the beginning of the iteration procedure. This also implies that the user may need to run
         * the function a few times before finding an optimal value for \f$ \alpha \f$. \n
         * Coming back to the choice of \f$ \chi_n \f$, the gradient descent method consists in choosing such
         * descent direction as the opposite of the gradient of the functional \f$ E[\psi] \f$ calculated in
         * \f$ \psi_n \f$ . So, in this case, the descent direction is (minus) the functional derivative of the
         * energy functional with respect to \f$ \psi^* \f$ evaluated at \f$ \psi_n \f$ , i.e.
         * \f[
         *
         * \chi_n = - \frac{\delta E[\psi_n]}{\delta \psi^*} =
         * - \left[ \frac{-\hbar^2\nabla^2}{2m}+V_{ext}({\bf r})+g|\psi_n|^2 \right] \psi_n
         *

         * The ground state wave function obtained from this algorithm is normalized in such a way to preserve the

         * the \f$ L^2 \f$ norm of the ground-state wave-function \f$ \psi \f$ should be included in the iteration
         * procedure by introducing a Lagrange multiplier and minimizing the corresponding lagrangian functional.
         * In practice, it is much cheaper to normalize ”by hand” each \f$ \psi_n \f$ obtained via the gradient
         * descent iteration, by fixing
         * \f[

         * order to speed up the convergence of the sequence \f$ {\psi_n} \f$. The method consists in adding a
         * ”momentum” term into the gradient-descent iterations, in order to make larger steps if the descent
         * direction does not change very much, and smaller steps if it changes a lot. In practice, what one does is
         * just to modify the gradient-descent expression in
         * \f$ \psi_{n+1} = \psi_n + \alpha \chi_n + \beta(\psi_n-\psi_{n-1}) \f$
         * where, again, \f$ \beta \f$ is a parameter chosen empirically and given to this function as input.

         * \f]
         * using the classic operator splitting technique.\n
         * The general idea of operator-splitting methods is to consider an initial value problem
         * \f[
         * y' = \text{A} y + \text{B} y
         * \f]
         * where \f$ A \f$ and \f$ B \f$ are differential operators, and solve the equation considering the actions
         * of the two operators separately. There is a vast literature on operator-splitting approaches for the
         * solution of differential equations, and different methods with a higher or lower level of accuracy. In the
         * case of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, things are even more simplified by the fact that part of the
         * method implies steps that can be solved *exactly*. \n
         * After choosing a time-step \f$ \Delta t \f$, the operator spltting scheme consists in the following steps
         * \f[
         * \begin{align}
         * & \text{For}   \quad n=0,1,\dots,\text{number_of_time_steps} \nonumber \\
         * & \text{Step 1: solve} \quad y'_1 = \text{A}y_1 \quad \text{in} \quad [t_n,t_n+\Delta t]
         * \quad \text{for} \quad y_1(0)=y(t_n) \nonumber \\
         * & \text{Step 2: solve} \quad y'_2 = \text{B}y_2 \quad \text{in} \quad [t_n,t_n+\Delta t]
         * \quad \text{for} \quad y_2(0)=y_1(t_n+\Delta t) \nonumber \\
         * & \text{Set} \quad y(t_{n+1}) = y_2(t_n+\Delta t) \nonumber \\
         * \end{align}
         * \f]
         * The steps imply the solution of an ordinary differential equation. In the case of the
         * Gross-Pitaevskii equation, a good choice of the operators \f$ A \f$ and \f$ B \f$ is the following
         * \f[
         * \begin{align}
         *  & A = V_{ext} + g |\psi(t)|^2 \nonumber \\
         *  & B = \frac{-\nabla^2}{2} \nonumber \\
         * \end{align}
         * \f]
         *
         * In this case, step 1, although involve the solution of a non-linear differential equation,
         * can be solved **analytically**. In fact, it is easy to show that the equation
         * \f[
         *  i\frac{d}{dt}\psi(t) = V_{ext} + g |\psi(t)|^2
         * \f]
         * preserves the norm \f$ \psi \f$ in time, and hence an explicit solution of this equation is
         * \f[
         * \psi(t+\Delta t) = e^{-i\Delta t\left( V_{ext} + g |\psi(t)|^2 \right)}\psi(t)
         * \f]
         * Moreover, also the second step of the method can be solved analytically, provided that one imposes
         * *periodic boundary conditions*. In fact, given the equation
         * \f[
         * i\frac{d}{dt}\psi(t) = \frac{-\nabla^2}{2}\psi(t)
         * \f]
         * and taking the Fourier transform (in space) at both sides, one finds
         * \f[
         * i\frac{d}{dt}\tilde{\psi}(t) = \frac{k^2}{2}\tilde{\psi}(t)
         * \f]
         * which can again be solved exactly as
         * \f[
         * \tilde{\psi}(t+\Delta t) = e^{-i\Delta t\frac{k^2}{2}}\tilde{\psi}(t)
         * \f]
         * Finally, an inverse Fourier transform allows to recover the solution back in real space, ready to take
         * another time step. \n
         * To summarize, this member function solves the Gross-Pitaevskii equation using classic operator
         * splitting via the following steps
         *  - Step 1) Set \f$ \psi(t_n + \Delta t) =
         *  e^{-i\Delta t\left( V_{ext} + g |\psi(t_n)|^2 \right)}\psi(t_n) \f$;
         *  - Step 2)
         *      - 2.1) Take the Fourier transform of \f$ \psi(t_n + \Delta t) \f$, and call
         *      it \f$ \tilde{\psi}(t_n) \f$;
         *      - 2.2) Set \f$ \tilde{\psi}(t_n+\Delta t) = e^{-i\Delta t\frac{k^2}{2}}\tilde{\psi}(t_n) \f$
         *      - 2.3) Take the inverse Fourier transform of \f$ \tilde{\psi}(t_n+\Delta t) \f$, and obtain
         *      \f$ \psi(t_n+\Delta t) \f$
         *
         * Notice that all these steps can be computed *locally*, meaning that we don't need additional vectors to
         * store intermediate values of \f$ \psi \f$.

         * When the temperature of a BEC is very close to the absolute zero, the simulation of the dynamics of the
         * system can be improved by properly taking into account the effects of quantum fluctuations on the initial
         * conditions for the dynamics. The Truncated Wigner Approximation (TWA) allows to simulate such effects using
         * so-called *c-field* techniques.
         *
         * A general introduction to the topic can be found in <href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.1487.pdf">
         * this review </a>. Here we just sketch the main ideas that lie behind the implementation of this class,
         *
         * The fundamental idea of all c-field methods is to divide the energy spectrum of the system into a
         * *c-field* region (often called coherent region), in which the dynamics of the low-energy, highly occupied
         * modes can be simulated by means of **classical** stochastic field equations (in our case, a simple
         * Gross-Pitaevskii equation), and an *incoherent* region, consisting of the remaining, higher energy modes,
         * which will be sparsely occupied because of thermal or vacuum excitations.
         *
         * The Truncated Wigner Approximation can be applied in the case in which we have several modes with a high
         * occupation in the c-field region, while many higher modes in the c-field region, as well as all the modes
         * of the incoherent region, are unoccupied.
         *
         * In these conditions, the quantum fluctuations in the c-field region have a significant effect, and this is
         * taken into account by including a random element corresponding to **half** a quantum occupation in each mode
         * in the initial conditions. This is needed in order to appropriately sample the Wigner quasi-probability
         * distribution. The successive dynamics is instead well described by the ordinary GPE.
         *
         * This function is supposed to be called right after a run of the member class
         * <code>run_gradient_descent()</code>, or at least in a condition in which the wave function has been
         * re-initialized to the ground state of the system via a call to the member function <code>reinit</code>. In
         * fact, calling \f$ \psi_0 \f$ the wave function currently known by the class, this function will transform
         * it in the coherent field \f$ \psi_c({\bf r}) = \psi_0({\bf r}) + \sum_{n} c_n\phi_n({\bf r}) \f$, where
         *  - \f$ c_n \f$ are independent randomly distributed *complex* Gaussian variables, with zero mean and variance
         *  equal to \f$ \frac{1}{2} \f$
         *  - if the member logical variable <code>system_is_in_harmonic_trap</code> is true, \f$ \psi_n \f$ are the
         *  eigenstates of the single-particle Hamiltonian of the system.
         *
         *  After this is done, one can run a new simulation by calling the member function
         *  <code>run_operator_splitting</code> to generate a new trajectory and calculate the desired ensemble
         *  averages of observables of interest.         *
