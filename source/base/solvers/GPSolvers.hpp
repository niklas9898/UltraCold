    /**
     * @brief Solver classes for various flavors of Gross-Pitaevskii equations.
     *
     * Ultra-cold bosonic systems are very often described in terms of the so-called
     * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross%E2%80%93Pitaevskii_equation"> Gross-Pitaevskii equation </a>, which
     * is a non-linear Schrodinger equation arising from a mean-field description of the system, valid when the
     * particles are very weakly interacting and the temperature is close to the absolute zero. In these conditions,
     * an ultra-cold gas of weakly interacting bosonic atoms is described by a complex order parameter \f$ \psi \f$,
     * whose square modulus gives the local density of atoms, and satisfying the following Gross-Pitaevskii equation
     * \f[
     *  i\hbar\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = \left[ \frac{-\hbar^2\nabla^2}{2m}+V_{ext}({\bf r})+g|\psi|^2
     * \right]\psi
     * \f]
     * Here \f$ V_{ext} \f$ is some external trapping potential, and \f$ g \f$ is related to the s-wave scattering
     * length \f$ a \f$ by \f$ g = \frac{4\pi\hbar^2a}{m} \f$. This model is valid as long as the two-body interaction
     * between the atoms can be modeled by a contact interaction of the form
     * \f$ V({\bf r}-{\bf r'})=g\delta({\bf r}-{\bf r'}) \f$. Other models (including, for example, a dipole-dipole
     * interaction and the effects of quantum fluctuations) have a similar form, as it is discussed in other solver
     * classes belonging to this namespace. \n
     * There are two kinds of information we can derive from the solution of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation:
     *  - *Ground-state properties*: these are obtained by searching for stationary solutions of the form
     * \f$ \psi({\bf r},t)=\psi_0({\bf r})e^{-i\mu t/\hbar} \f$, obtaining the stationary Gross-Pitaevskii equation
     *
     * \f[
     *  \mu \psi_0 = \left[ \frac{-\hbar^2\nabla^2}{2m}+V_{ext}({\bf r})+g|\psi_0|^2 \right]\psi_0
     * \f]
     *
     * Solving this for the smallest eigenvalue \f$ \mu \f$, which represents the chemical potential,
     * gives access to the ground-state configuration of the system.
     *  - *Dynamics*: solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for appropriate initial conditions allows to simulate the
     * dynamical behavior of the system and to compare the results of the model with experiments.
     *
     * In order to solve these equations, there are several possibilities. \n
     * For what concern the stationary Gross-Pitaevskii equation, one possibility comes from noticing that such equation
     * can be obtained from a constrained minimization formulation of the problem, in particular by requiring that the
     * ground-state order parameter of the system is the exact minimizer of the mean-field energy functional
     *
     * \f[
     *  E[\psi] = \int d{\bf r} \left[ \psi^*({\bf r})\left(\frac{-\hbar^2\nabla^2}{2m}+V_{ext}({\bf r})\right)
     *  \psi({\bf r}) \right]+\frac{g}{2}\int d{\bf r} |\psi({\bf r})|^4
     * \f]
     *
     * under the constraint of a fixed number of particles \f$ \int d{\bf r}|\psi({\bf r})|^2=N \f$. This allows also to
     * introduce the chemical potential \f$ \mu \f$ as the Lagrange multiplier fixing the total number of particles. One
     * can hence find the ground state order parameter and chemical potential using, for example, a
     * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent"> gradient descent </a> method, as implemented in the
     * class GPSolver (see the related documentation). \n
     * For what concern instead the full Gross-Pitaevskii equation, this is solved using a classical
     * operator-splitting method. See again the full documentation of the GPSolver class for more details.

         *
         * This class allows to solve the Gross-Pitaevskii equation
         *
         * \f[
         *  i\hbar\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = \left[ \frac{-\hbar^2\nabla^2}{2m}+V_{ext}({\bf r})+g|\psi|^2
         * \right]\psi
         * \f]
         *
         * both for ground-state configurations as well as for the dynamics, on a cartesian mesh with periodic
         * boundary conditions. The basic usage of the class is as follows:
         *
         * \code {.cpp}
         *
         *  GPSolver gp_solver(x,y,z,psi0,Vext,scattering_length);
         *
         *  // for ground state calculations
         *
         *  std::tie(psi,chemical_potential) = gp_solver.run_gradient_descent(maximum_number_of_iterations,
         *                                                                    tolerance,
         *                                                                    alpha,
         *                                                                    beta,
         *                                                                    std::cout);
         *  // or
         *
         *  gp_solver.run_operator_splitting(number_of_time_steps,time_step); // for the dynamics
         *
         * \endcode
         *
         * In the constructor, you need to provide the (cartesian) axis along which you want to solve the equation (of
         * course, 1, 2 or 3), the initial wave function (all the methods are iterative) and the external potential. All
         * of these must be properly initialized before passing them to the solver class. \n
         * For ground-state calculations, it is possible to generate some output at each step of the gradient-descent
         * iterations. By default, the GPSolver::run_gradient_descent() just writes, in the standard output, the current
         * iteration number, chemical potential and norm of the residual. This default behavior can however be
         * customized by overriding the GPSolver::write_gradient_descent_output() member function. \n
         * A similar behavior is the default also for dynamics calculations, i.e. for the member function
         * GPSolver::run_operator_splitting(). In this case, the default is just to write the current time step and current
         * time. For examples of usage and customization via overloading, see the example 1 in the
         * <code>examples</code> folder.
         * \note Several member functions of this class take advantage of
         * <a href="https://www.openmp.org/"> OpenMP </a> parallelization. For optimal performance, be sure to run
         * \code
         * $ export OMP_NUM_THREADS=<number of physical cores on the machine used>
         * \endcode
         * on the shell before the program execution.
         * \warning The Gross-Pitaevskii equation is solved in its a-dimensional form. In the case of a harmonic
         * potential in one space dimension it has the form
         *
         * \f[
         *  i\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = \left[ -\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}+\frac{1}{2}x^2
         *  +4\pi a|\psi|^2 \right]\psi
         * \f]
         * where \f$ a \f$ is the scattering length, which here must be given in harmonic units. Be sure to
         * provide the axis, initial wave function, and external potential initialized properly. See the examples in
         * the examples folder.

         * and the scattering length \f$ a \f$. \n
         *
         * Experimental measurements and microscopic Monte Carlo calculations have confirmed that the LHY term is an
         * accurate correction to the mean-field theory given by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in dipolar gases, and it
         * is **fundamental** in the description of the currently available experimental phenomenology. \n
         *
         * In **two space dimensions**, the dipole-dipole interaction assumes a different form. A typical situation of
         * both theoretical and experimental interest is the one in which the system is strongly confined along the
         * \f$z\f$-axis with a tight harmonic trap, such that \f$\hbar\omega_z >> \mu\f$, where \f$ \mu \f$ is the
         * chemical potential. In this condition, the condensate wave-function can be factorized as
         *
         * \f[
         *  \Psi(x,y,z,t) = \chi(z)\psi(x,y,t)
         * \f]
         *
         * where \f$\chi(z)\f$ is the ground-state wave function of the harmonic oscillator along the z-direction.
         * Inserting this ansatz into the mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii equation and integrating out the z-direction,
         * one finds that the contact interaction parameter \f$g\f$ is renormalized by the factor \f$1/\sqrt{2\pi}l_z\f$,
         * where \f$l_z=\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{m\omega_z}}\f$ is the harmonic oscillator length along the \f$z\f$-axis,
         * while the dipole-dipole interaction potential can be rewritten as (for more details, see for example
         * <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.4129.pdf"> here </a>)
         *
         * \f[
         *  \Phi_{dd}({\bf r},t) =
         *  \mathrm{FT}^{-1}\left[\tilde{n}({\bf k},t)\tilde{U}_{dd}^{2D}\left(\frac{{\bf k}l_z}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\right]
         * \f]
         * where \f$\mathrm{FT}^{-1}\f$ indicates the inverse Fourier transform, \f$\tilde{n}({\bf k},t)\f$ is the
         * Fourier transform of the density profile at time \f$t\f$, and the dipole-dipole interaction in
         * this quasi-two-dimensional setup is given, in momentum space, by
         *
         * \f[
         *  U_{dd}^{2D}({\bf q}) = \frac{4\pi}{3}g_{dd}
         *  \left[ F_{\parallel}({\bf q})\sin^2(\alpha) + F_{\perp}({\bf q})\cos^2(\alpha)  \right]
         * \f]
         *
         * with \f$ g_{dd} = \frac{\mu_0\mu^2}{4\pi\sqrt{2\pi}l_z} \f$,
         * \f$ F_{\parallel}({\bf q}) =  -1+3\sqrt{\pi}\frac{q_x^2}{q}\mathrm{e}^{q^2}\mathrm{erfc}(q)\f$,
         * \f$ F_{\perp}({\bf q}) =  2-3\sqrt{\pi}q\mathrm{e}^{q^2}\mathrm{erfc}(q)\f$, where \f$\mathrm{erfc}\f$ is the
         * <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_function"> complementary error function </a>, and \f$\alpha\f$
         * is the angle between the polarization direction and the z-axis (assuming that the projection of the
         * polarization direction in the \f$x\f$-\f$y\f$ plane is along the \f$x\f$-axis).
         *
         * \note
         * In the two-dimensional solver, at the time of writing, the Lee-Huang-Yang correction is **not implemented**.
         * This is because there are no available experiments at this time, and it is not clear whether or not such
         * correction is necessary to describe the physics of the dipolar Bose gas in quasi-2D.
         *
         * This class can be used to solve the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation both for ground-state configurations
         * as well as for the dynamics, on a cartesian mesh with periodic boundary conditions. The basic usage of the
         * class for **three dimensional problems** is is as follows:
         *
         * \code {.cpp}
         *
         *  DipolarGPSolver dipolar_gp_solver(x,
         *                                    y,
         *                                    z,
         *                                    psi0,
         *                                    Vext,
         *                                    scattering_length,
         *                                    dipolar_length,

         *                                    theta_mu);
         *
         *  // for ground state calculations
         *
         *  std::tie(psi,chemical_potential) = dipolar_gp_solver.run_gradient_descent(maximum_number_of_iterations,
         *                                                                            tolerance,
         *                                                                            alpha,
         *                                                                            beta,
         *                                                                            std::cout);
         *
         *  // or
         *
         *  dipolar_gp_solver.run_operator_splitting(number_of_time_steps,time_step); // for the dynamics
         *
         * \endcode
         *
         * while for **two-dimensional problems**, the constructor is the following
         *
         * \code{.cpp}
         *
         *  DipolarGPSolver dipolar_gp_solver(x,

         *                                    psi0,
         *                                    Vext,

         *
         * \endcode
         *
         * In the constructor, you need to provide the cartesian axis defining the mesh on which the equation
         * is going to be solved, the initial wave function (all the methods are iterative), the external potential,
         * the s-wave scattering length \f$ a \f$ and the dipolar length \f$ a_{dd} \f$, both in appropriate units, as
         * well as the tilting angles. \n
         * The algorithms used and their working principles are the same as those used for a non-dipolar Bose gas,
         * described in the documentation of the GPSolver class. See that documentation for details.
         * \note Several member functions of this class take advantage of
         * <a href="https://www.openmp.org/"> OpenMP </a> parallelization. For optimal performance, be sure to run

         * \warning The extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation is solved in its a-dimensional form, which, in the case
