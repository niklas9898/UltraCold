\section About

%UltraCold is a modular and extensible collection of C++ libraries for the study of ultra-cold atomic systems in the
context of Gross-Pitaevskii theory.  \n

The package contains several solver classes for different flavors of Gross-Pitaevskii and Bogolyubov equations, allowing
for the description of ultra-cold systems of bosons at the mean-field level, studying their ground-state properties,
the dynamics, and elementary excitations.

All the solver classes (both for Gross-Pitaevskii and Bogolyubov equations) take advantage of OpenMP parallelization.
Gpu-accelerated solvers, written in CUDA, for the various flavors of Gross-Pitaevskii equations, are also available.

\section Required Prerequisites and platforms

%UltraCold has been only tested with Intel oneAPI, although it should also work with previous versions
of Intel Parallel Studio. The Intel oneAPI package can be downloaded **for free** from
<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/toolkits.html"> here </a>.
In particular, UltraCold relies on the
<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/base-toolkit-download.html">
 Intel oneAPI Base Toolkit</a>
and on the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/hpc-toolkit-download.html">
Intel oneAPI HPC Toolkit</a>.

If you also want to take advantage of GPU acceleration, you need CUDA to be installed on your system (as well as, of
course, an NVIDIA GPU). The package has been tested only with CUDA 11.0, but should work also with some previous
version.

The package has been tested only on Linux machines, including several laptops/PCs, but also on High Performance
Computing clusters, including <a href="https://www.hpc.cineca.it/hardware/galileo100"> Galileo100 </a> from the italian
supercomputing consortium <a href="https://www.cineca.it/"> CINECA </a>, and
<a href="https://wiki.bwhpc.de/e/Category:BwForCluster_JUSTUS_2"> JUSTUS2 </a> from the
<a href="https://wiki.bwhpc.de/e/Main_Page"> bwHPC </a> consortium of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, Germany.

\section Installation

To get %UltraCold, first clone it into your machine

\code
git clone https://github.com/smroccuzzo/UltraCold.git
\endcode

Then, enter the directory %UltraCold, and follow the usual steps required to build a project using
<a href="https://cmake.org/"> cmake </a>. By default, the build type is *Release*. So, all you have to do is
\code
cd UltraCold
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=</your/install/path> ..
make
make install
\endcode

If you want to build also the libraries that use GPU acceleration, you have to pass an additional flag to cmake, as follows

\code

cd UltraCold
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=</your/install/path> -DULTRACOLD_WITH_CUDA=ON ..
make
make install

\endcode

Notice that it is typically necessary to set in advance the environment variables required to work with Intel or CUDA
tools. Both packages are typically distributed with some bash script that set those variables automatically for you.
Moreover, on most HPC clusters, such variables are set with a command like

\code

module load <my package>

\endcode

but the details depends on cluster you are actually working on.

\section Usage Usage and examples

%UltraCold comes packed with several solver classes for different flavors of Gross-Pitaevskii and Bogolyubov-like
equations. The complete list of available solvers, as well as other useful classes (e.g. for data output) is
available under the namespace UltraCold. \n

The \subpage examples section provides several examples of usage of the basic functionalities of the package (as well as
some physics). Such examples are meant to be used as templates for more complex applications, combining the
functionality of the package to develop some interesting physics.

\section Contributing

%UltraCold is developed using <a href="https://git-scm.com/"> Git </a> as a version control tool, and
<a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> as the central host of the source code.

If you find some issue, and/or have suggestions for additions and/or improvements, please open a
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues">GitHub issue</a>.

If you want to actively contribute, after opening an issue, follow this (pretty standard) workflow, based on the
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models">
fork and pull model</a>:

- If you already have a GitHub account, <a href="https://github.com/login">sign in</a>. Otherwise,
<a href="https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home">create
one </a> (it's free, and we are pretty confident that it will always be).
- Fork the %UltraCold project.
- Make a local clone of your fork to your own computer.
- Create a new branch on which you will be making changes. This marks the point from which your copy of the project
starts to differ from that of the main development branch.
- Start to make your changes, for example by modifying existing files and/or creating new ones. Once you are
satisfied with your changes, you can commit each change, in such a way that Git can keep track of them. With each commit,
write a short message describing what your particular set of changes does.
- When you're finished committing all of your changes to your local repository, you can push them all upstream to your
GitHub repository.
- Finally, open a pull request on GitHub to the main development repository (i.e., by now,
<a href="https://github.com/smroccuzzo/UltraCold">this</a> one).
